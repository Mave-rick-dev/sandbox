To only combine changes from the same topic in a single commit.
git add -p <file-path>
- deals with the file staging at patch level, hence the letter p.
- observation: using partial flag prevents the changes to be staged (until next commit??)

Branching strategies:
    i. GitHub flow
        - main + feature branch only
    ii. GitFlow
        - multiple dedicated branches dealing with specific phase during dev

But branching strategies are business specific

Long vs Short-Lived Branches
 - (main, develop, stag) vs (feature, fixes, poc)
 - no direct commits on long-lived branches i.e. only through a merge|rebase
    - quality: tested, reviewed
    - bundled release
 - shot-lived branch is rebased|merged on the long-lived branch then deleted

MR (GitLab) vs PR (GitHub)
- to integrate changes from one branch to another
- to have a second pair of eye

Merge Conflicts
- courtesy to git
- changes when contradicts, for instance, same line of code is changed in two commits in two different branches
- conflicts marker:
    - after merge command -- CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <fileName>
    - status [Merging <branchName>] at bottom-right corner in IntelliJ
    - after git status -- You have unmerged paths.
                           (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
                           (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)
- conflicts resolved marker:
    - after removing conflicts -- On branch newBranch
      All conflicts fixed, but you are still merging.
       (use "git commit" to conclude merge)
- merge concludes only after committing the resolved conflicts
- useful merge tools:
    - mergetool -- to modify or delete file, or to abort merge

pull requests are always based on branches not on individual commits.
- in practice, we are simply creating a new branch that we want to include in the main (some other branch) as a PR

to fork a GitHub repository
- is to have pull the entire project of the concerned repo in your personal space
- once you fork a repo, you can raise PR with your changes onto its original hub
- scenario can be, you forked the kafka open source project repo, added custom audit logger impls, then wants to forward it to your forked kafka repo to run it with your newly added feature
- for worthy changes, you might request the official kafka repo maintainer for review by sending a PR through your forked kafka repo

changes to push


Merge vs Rebase

Scenario: Want to migrate changes from B2 into B1
(CC)--->(C1)-->(C2)-->(C2)    ]--------------------] Branch-1: development newton
   |
   |-->(CA)-->(CB)            ]--------------------] Branch-2: fixes ktj


Git Merge flow:
(CC)--->(C1)-->(C2)-->(C2)--->(C3)
   |                            |
   |-->(CA)-->(CB)--------------|

    - combines varying changes of two diff branches
    - marked by the commit after merge
        - a single commit for all changes in the short-lived branch
    - exhibits non-linear history log
    - all logs of merge history, hence preferred for tracking the origin(branch) of each commit
    - contributors can track the origin of each foreign commits in their branch
    - git marks the Common Commit (CC) point for B2
    - then migrates the changes into the B1
    - CA + CB = C3 means entire B2 changes will be reflected in B1 as C3


Git Rebase flow:
(CC)--->(C1)-->(C2)-->(C2)--->(CA)-->(CB)  ]--------] Branch-1: main
   |                      |
   |-->(CA)-->(CB)--------|                ]--------] Branch-2: fixes

    - CA and CB (parked commits) is rewritten in B1 git history
    - rewrites the commit history, in a sense appends the commits of short-lived branch
    - exhibits linear history log
    - no logs of merged history, hence cannot pinpoint the origin branch of appended commit
    - suitable for private project
