To only combine changes from the same topic in a single commit.
git add -p <file-path>
- deals with the file staging at patch level, hence the letter p.
- observation: using partial flag prevents the changes to be staged (until next commit??)

pull requests are always based on branches not on individual commits.

to fork a github repository
- is to have excact replica of the concerned repo in your personal github account
- once you fork a repo, you can raise PR with your changes onto its original hub
